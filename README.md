# LingoLift (Static Version)

LingoLift is an interactive web application designed to help users practice and improve their English-to-Portuguese translation skills.

**Note:** This is the standalone version of LingoLift that **does not use AI**. While the full version of LingoLift utilizes Artificial Intelligence to generate infinite news articles and provide dynamic, context-aware corrections, this specific version runs entirely on a static, pre-defined internal library. It is designed for offline practice and demonstration purposes without requiring external API keys.

## How it Works

1.  **Practice Text**: The application presents a random English text from a curated internal library (currently featuring 30 diverse scenarios).
2.  **Translation**: The user enters their Portuguese translation in the dedicated input area.
3.  **Review & Comparison**: Upon checking the translation, the app switches to a results view that offers:
    *   **Side-by-Side Comparison**: Displays the user's translation next to a reference translation.
    *   **Detailed Breakdown**: Analyzes the text phrase-by-phrase, providing the exact meaning of specific segments.
    *   **Alternative Translations**: Offers valid alternative ways to translate specific phrases to broaden vocabulary.

## Educational Purpose
